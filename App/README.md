TradeLinx is a B2B cross-border trade platform connecting African suppliers with buyers, starting with Nigeria. This MVP includes:

- **Backend:** Node.js Express API (`/backend`)

- **Database & Auth:** Supabase (to be integrated)

## Features

- Supplier onboarding (business docs upload, admin approval)
- Buyer onboarding (simple, instant access)
- Marketplace (supplier dashboard, product upload, P2P messaging)
- Escrow payment simulation
- Admin panel (approve suppliers, monitor conversations, manage users)

## Getting Started
1. `cd backend && npm install && npm start` (starts backend on default port)
2. Frontend setup: (Flutter web/mobile, coming next)

## Folder Structure
- `/backend` — Node.js Express API
- `/frontend` — Flutter app (to be created)
