# TradeLinx MVP
- This workspace contains a Node.js Express backend (in `/backend`).
- The frontend (Flutter) will be added in `/frontend`.
- Use red & white minimalist UI for all user-facing components.
- Prioritize mobile-first layouts and clean, modern fonts (e.g., Inter, DM Sans).
- Backend should use RESTful APIs and integrate with Supabase for authentication, file storage, and database.
- Scaffold and document all onboarding, authentication, and admin features as described in the MVP requirements.
